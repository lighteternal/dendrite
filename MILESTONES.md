# TargetGraph Milestones

- [x] M1: Initialize git repo and monorepo scaffold (`apps/web`, `services/*`).
- [x] M2: Bootstrap Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- [x] M3: Implement backend contracts, SSE stream pipeline, rank/hypothesis APIs.
- [x] M4: Implement landing page and graph workbench UI with Cytoscape + Sankey + Hypothesis Mode.
- [x] M5: Wire local MCP service orchestration via Docker Compose.
- [x] M6: Finalize docs, runbook, credibility links, and validation checklist.
- [x] M7: Redesign UI/UX to high-contrast translational workbench (light theme, improved typography, clearer cards).
- [x] M8: Upgrade graph rendering to force-directed canvas + robust Sankey readability and interaction polish.
- [x] M9: Improve customer workflow (main-search navigation, in-workbench rerun, executive readout, clearer value framing).
- [x] M10: End-to-end validation via Chromium automation on 5 diseases + lint/build checks.
- [x] M11: UI readability + IA split-screen pass (Network/Evidence/Hypothesis tabs), disease-only entity matching hardening, and second E2E/API validation sweep.
- [x] M12: Deep Discoverer agent workflow (LangGraph + DeepAgents-style subagents) with live SSE journey and graph-focus integration.
- [x] M13: Reliability/readability hardening pass (Reactome fail-soft per target, faster BioMCP budget, richer Sankey coverage, improved node label spacing, executive natural-language brief).
- [x] M14: Decision-brief-first rebuild (NL-first landing, `/brief` workspace, `/api/runCaseStream`, disease resolver guardrails, path-first graph declutter, and 5-disease regression validation).
