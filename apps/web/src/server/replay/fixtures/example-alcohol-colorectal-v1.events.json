Most cases of colon cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition. Approximately 3-5% of colon cancer is considered 'hereditary' and is thought to be caused by an inherited predisposition tocolon cancer that is passed down through a family in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. In some of these families, the underlying genetic cause is not known; however, many of these cases are caused by changes (mutations) in the APC , MYH , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , EPCAM , PTEN , STK11 , SMAD4 , BMPR1A , NTHL1 , POLE , and POLD1 genes (which are associated with hereditary cancer syndromes). An additional 10-30% of people diagnosed with colon cancer have a significant family history of the condition but have no identifiable mutation in a gene known to cause a hereditary predisposition to colon cancer. These clusters of colon cancer are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle. High-risk cancer screening and other preventative measures such as prophylactic surgeries are typically recommended in people who have an increased risk for colon cancer based on their personal and/or family histories."

Several article and trial snippets in the evidence set associate alcohol-related pathways with colorectal cancer risk and clinicopathologic features [36][37][38][39].\n- ADH1B (alcohol dehydrogenase 1B) emerges as the mechanistic connector: the active path summary confirms a colorectal cancer -> ADH1B -> alcohol dependence thread, and ADH1B has high aggregated evidence in the snapshot (recommended target score 0.8727 with OpenTargets evidence cited). ADH1B genetic polymorphisms and expression changes are known to modulate the rate of ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde, a reactive carcinogen.\n- Mechanistic reasoning: increased acetaldehyde levels (from high alcohol intake and/or reduced aldehyde clearance) cause DNA adducts and interfere with DNA repair processes. The evidence set includes MMR (mismatch repair) pathway entities (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2) that are central to colorectal carcinogenesis; impaired repair (sporadic or Lynch-related) would make epithelial cells more vulnerable to acetaldehyde-induced mutagenesis and microsatellite instability phenotypes. The evidence summary also highlights MSH2 as a plausible alternative connector, consistent with interactions between DNA repair status and alcohol-related mutagenesis.\n- Clinical-trial and registry signals: multiple trial snippets focus on MMR genes in colorectal cancer (MSH2, MSH6), indicating active investigation into how DNA repair status stratifies patients and may interact with environmental exposures such as alcohol. This supports testing ADH1B in the context of MMR-deficiency status.\n- Interaction topology: the confirmed path links colorectal cancer to ADH1B and to alcohol dependence, suggesting two relevant axes—(1) host behavior/exposure. ### Biological interpretation\n- Mechanism bullets that support the recommendation and decision impact:\n- - ADH1B enzymatic activity determines conversion rate of alcohol (ethanol) to acetaldehyde; functional ADH1B variants that increase or decrease activity alter acetaldehyde burden in colonic mucosa and systemic circulation, directly affecting carcinogen exposure.\n- - Acetaldehyde is a genotoxic metabolite that forms DNA adducts and crosslinks; in the setting of impaired mismatch repair (MSH2/MSH6/MLH1/PMS2), acetaldehyde-induced lesions are less effectively corrected, increasing mutation burden and promoting colorectal tumor initiation and progression.\n- - Behavioral axis: alcohol dependence increases cumulative alcohol exposure and therefore acetaldehyde formation; coupling dependence status with ADH1B genotype/expression refines patient-level risk assessment.\n- Clinical implication: ADH1B genotype or tumor/adjacent mucosal ADH1B expression may be a biomarker for alcohol-related CRC risk stratification and for counseling on alcohol reduction. In tumors, high acetaldehyde exposure signatures (e.g., specific mutational spectra) combined with MMR deficiency could identify patients with an alcohol-driven mutational etiology. ### What to test next\nPrioritized experiments and translational studies: 1. Cohort association study (translational): In a well-annotated colorectal cancer cohort with alcohol consumption data, genotype for common ADH1B polymorphisms and measure ADH1B mRNA/protein in tumor and adjacent normal mucosa. Readouts: correlation of ADH1B genotype/expression with (a) acetaldehyde adduct biomarkers in tissue or blood, (b) tumor mutational signatures (mutation burden and spectra), (c) clinical outcomes (stage, recurrence, survival). Expected outcome: a positive correlation would support ADH1B as a mediator linking alcohol to CRC risk and prognosis. 2. ### Residual uncertainty\nDirect causal proof that ADH1B variation mediates alcohol-driven colorectal carcinogenesis in humans is not yet established by randomized data; available evidence is correlational and informed by molecular plausibility.",

        "answer": "### Working conclusion\nGenetic variation or altered expression of alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) is a plausible mechanistic link between alcohol exposure and colorectal cancer (CRC); therefore, the next practical steps are (1) genotype ADH1B and measure ADH1B mRNA/protein in tumor and adjacent normal mucosa in an alcohol-annotated CRC cohort, and (2) assay tissue or blood acetaldehyde-adduct biomarkers and tumor mutational features to test whether ADH1B status associates with increased acetaldehyde burden and mutation patterns in CRC [35][31][36]. These cohort-level analyses will establish whether the confirmed disease–target–exposure path (colorectal cancer -> ADH1B -> alcohol dependence) maps onto measurable biochemical and genomic consequences in patients [31][35]. ### Evidence synthesis\n- The curated graph context explicitly connects colorectal cancer to ADH1B and links ADH1B to alcohol dependence, forming the path colorectal cancer -> ADH1B -> alcohol dependence; aggregated evidence metrics for ADH1B are high (OpenTargets evidence ~0.916) and literature support/network centrality metrics are reported as strong [31][34]. Citation records include dedicated ADH1B literature entries consistent with mechanistic relevance [35].\n- Multiple colorectal cancer studies and gene-expression profiling reports are present in the evidence set, indicating active characterization of CRC-associated genes and clinicopathologic correlates; these references support interrogating gene-level contributors in CRC biology but do not by themselves prove causation between alcohol and CRC via ADH1B [36][37][38][39].\n- Trial and registry entries in the evidence set highlight concurrent clinical interest in DNA repair genes (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2) in CRC populations, indicating that tumor mismatch repair (MMR) status is an accessible and relevant stratifier in CRC studies and trials [16][10][6][7][9][8].\n- The assembled evidence shows strong domain-level support for ADH1B as a connective node between an alcohol-related phenotype and CRC, but direct human causal evidence that ADH1B mediates alcohol-driven colorectal carcinogenesis (e.g., prospective intervention or Mendelian-randomization results within these citations) is not cited in the provided ledger [31][35][36]. ### Biological interpretation\n- ADH1B is the encoded enzyme for a major ethanol-oxidizing activity; variation in ADH1B function can plausibly alter local/systemic acetaldehyde exposure following alcohol consumption, creating a mechanistic route from alcohol intake to genotoxic metabolite burden in colonic tissues (graph path: colorectal cancer -> ADH1B -> alcohol dependence) [35][31].\n- Tumor MMR genes (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2) are represented in the citation set and are biologically relevant modifiers of how DNA damage is processed in colorectal epithelium; if acetaldehyde-induced lesions are present, deficient MMR could plausibly increase fixation of mutations, making MMR status an important contextual variable when testing ADH1B-mediated effects in CRC [16][10][11][14][28].\n- The current evidence supports treating ADH1B as a mediator candidate (biochemical enzyme affecting ethanol → acetaldehyde) rather than as a proven causal driver of CRC in humans; supportive data in the ledger include high association metrics and gene-focused CRC profiling studies, but direct empirical linkage of ADH1B genotype/expression to acetaldehyde adducts or to CRC incidence/progression within these specific citations is not demonstrated [31][35][36][37][38][39]. ### What to test next\n1) Cohort association study (priority): In a CRC patient cohort with quantified alcohol intake, perform ADH1B genotyping and measure ADH1B mRNA/protein in tumor and adjacent normal mucosa. Readouts: tissue/blood acetaldehyde-adduct levels, tumor mutational burden and mutational signatures, and clinical outcomes (stage, recurrence, survival). Strengthening result: ADH1B variants or low/high expression correlate with higher acetaldehyde adducts and with mutation patterns consistent with genotoxic exposure and worse outcomes. Weakening result: no association between ADH1B status and acetaldehyde markers or tumor genomic features despite accurate exposure data. (Rationale: leverages the confirmed path and available CRC gene-expression resources [31][35][36].) ### Residual uncertainty\nThe citations substantiate ADH1B as a high-confidence disease-associated node and show active investigation of CRC gene signatures and MMR status, but the ledger does not include direct causal human studies demonstrating that ADH1B variation changes acetaldehyde burden in CRC patients.",

        "answer": "### Working conclusion\nGenetic variation or altered expression of alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) is a plausible mechanistic link between alcohol exposure and colorectal cancer (CRC); therefore, the next practical steps are (1) genotype ADH1B and measure ADH1B mRNA/protein in tumor and adjacent normal mucosa in an alcohol-annotated CRC cohort, and (2) assay tissue or blood acetaldehyde-adduct biomarkers and tumor mutational features to test whether ADH1B status associates with increased acetaldehyde burden and mutation patterns in CRC [35][31][36]. These cohort-level analyses will establish whether the confirmed disease–target–exposure path (colorectal cancer -> ADH1B -> alcohol dependence) maps onto measurable biochemical and genomic consequences in patients [31][35]. ### Evidence synthesis\n- The curated graph context explicitly connects colorectal cancer to ADH1B and links ADH1B to alcohol dependence, forming the path colorectal cancer -> ADH1B -> alcohol dependence; aggregated evidence metrics for ADH1B are high (OpenTargets evidence ~0.916) and literature support/network centrality metrics are reported as strong [31][34]. Citation records include dedicated ADH1B literature entries consistent with mechanistic relevance [35].\n- Multiple colorectal cancer studies and gene-expression profiling reports are present in the evidence set, indicating active characterization of CRC-associated genes and clinicopathologic correlates; these references support interrogating gene-level contributors in CRC biology but do not by themselves prove causation between alcohol and CRC via ADH1B [36][37][38][39].\n- Trial and registry entries in the evidence set highlight concurrent clinical interest in DNA repair genes (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2) in CRC populations, indicating that tumor mismatch repair (MMR) status is an accessible and relevant stratifier in CRC studies and trials [16][10][6][7][9][8].\n- The assembled evidence shows strong domain-level support for ADH1B as a connective node between an alcohol-related phenotype and CRC, but direct human causal evidence that ADH1B mediates alcohol-driven colorectal carcinogenesis (e.g., prospective intervention or Mendelian-randomization results within these citations) is not cited in the provided ledger [31][35][36]. ### Biological interpretation\n- ADH1B is the encoded enzyme for a major ethanol-oxidizing activity; variation in ADH1B function can plausibly alter local/systemic acetaldehyde exposure following alcohol consumption, creating a mechanistic route from alcohol intake to genotoxic metabolite burden in colonic tissues (graph path: colorectal cancer -> ADH1B -> alcohol dependence) [35][31].\n- Tumor MMR genes (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2) are represented in the citation set and are biologically relevant modifiers of how DNA damage is processed in colorectal epithelium; if acetaldehyde-induced lesions are present, deficient MMR could plausibly increase fixation of mutations, making MMR status an important contextual variable when testing ADH1B-mediated effects in CRC [16][10][11][14][28].\n- The current evidence supports treating ADH1B as a mediator candidate (biochemical enzyme affecting ethanol → acetaldehyde) rather than as a proven causal driver of CRC in humans; supportive data in the ledger include high association metrics and gene-focused CRC profiling studies, but direct empirical linkage of ADH1B genotype/expression to acetaldehyde adducts or to CRC incidence/progression within these specific citations is not demonstrated [31][35][36][37][38][39]. ### What to test next\n1) Cohort association study (priority): In a CRC patient cohort with quantified alcohol intake, perform ADH1B genotyping and measure ADH1B mRNA/protein in tumor and adjacent normal mucosa. Readouts: tissue/blood acetaldehyde-adduct levels, tumor mutational burden and mutational signatures, and clinical outcomes (stage, recurrence, survival). Strengthening result: ADH1B variants or low/high expression correlate with higher acetaldehyde adducts and with mutation patterns consistent with genotoxic exposure and worse outcomes. Weakening result: no association between ADH1B status and acetaldehyde markers or tumor genomic features despite accurate exposure data. (Rationale: leverages the confirmed path and available CRC gene-expression resources [31][35][36].) ### Residual uncertainty\nThe citations substantiate ADH1B as a high-confidence disease-associated node and show active investigation of CRC gene signatures and MMR status, but the ledger does not include direct causal human studies demonstrating that ADH1B variation changes acetaldehyde burden in CRC patients.",
